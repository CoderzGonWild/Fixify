# Fixify

Fixify is a mobile application created with Android Studio. This was a project that was created for SEG2105: Introduction to Software Engineering. 

The project went through 4 phases where we worked on functions for each type of user per phase. 

## 1. Registration and Logging in

Upon app start up, the user should be able to either login as an administrator by typing in the username and password as "admin" or register for an account as either a service provider or a homeowner. 

## 2. Administrator

The administrator is able to create services to be offered by the service provider as well as delete services and edit the hourly rates of already created services.

## 3. Service Provider

The service provider is able to create a profile with their information and add and remove services from their profile. 

## 4. Homeowner

The homeowner is able to search for service providers and then book a service with them. After the service has been booked, they are able to rate the service provider and provide a comment for them.
